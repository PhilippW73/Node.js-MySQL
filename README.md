How it works
(1) the app works like amazon or any other internet shop. the user is able to chose a product and order the item
(2) the user can access the app in terminal. enter --> node bamazonCustomer_1.js
(3) in this example app, the user sees 10 products with item_id, product_name, department and stock_quantity
(4) the user will be asked to chose an id from a product and then enter the requested quantity (see PS1.png)
(5) the user can only order when the quantity on stock is bigger than the requested quantity
(6) once the user inputed the requested information, the purchase is confirmed and the stock quantity is updated (see PS2)
